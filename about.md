# JustEnoughKeybinds
Sometimes it just feels like there aren't enough keybinds to navigate around Geometry Dash's UI itself. JustEnoughKeybinds aims to fix that. (Formerly part of ErysEdits.)

Support currently includes:
- The level editor (Save, Save and Exit, Save and Play, Exit without Saving)
- The pause menu (Restart, Full Restart, Edit Level)
- The level search menu (quick toggles for length/difficulty filters, shortcuts for advanced filters, toggle between searching for levels/lists)
- User profiles, comments sections, level/level list menus, leaderboards (refresh page, tab switching, first/previous + next/last pages) <cy>([BetterInfo](mod:cvolton.betterinfo) may be required in some cases)</c>
- A few other menus not worth listing here without making this list too long
