# JustEnoughKeybinds
Sometimes it just feels like there aren't enough keybinds to navigate around Geometry Dash's UI itself. JustEnoughKeybinds aims to fix that. (Formerly part of ErysEdits.)

Support currently includes:
- The level editor (Save, Save and Exit, Save and Play, Exit without Saving)
- The pause menu (Restart, Full Restart, Edit Level)
- The level search menu (quick toggles for length/difficulty filters, shortcuts for advanced filters, toggle between searching for levels/lists)
- A few other menus not worth listing here without making this list too long

Shortcuts for Refresh, Previous/Next Page, and First/Last Page are also available in most menus from vanilla GD:\

- Leaderboards
- Level browsing
- Viewing comments
- The icon kit
